  <h2>Explanation:</h2>
  <p>This refers to how many times your child took a turn in a back-and-forth interaction with someone. A turn includes responding to someone or initiating something new (like answering a question or asking one).</p>

  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your child pointed to the TV (1st turn), you asked, “Do you want to watch something?” (2nd turn), and your child nodded or said “yes” (3rd turn). That’s three turns in one short conversation.</li>
  </ul>
