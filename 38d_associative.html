  <h2>Explanation:</h2>
  <p>Your child played near other children, shared toys or materials, and talked with them during play. They noticed and responded to each other, but each child still worked on their own separate activity without a shared goal.</p>

  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Two children sitting at a table with LEGO blocks, talking about what they are building, but each making a different structure</li><li>Children painting side-by-side, sharing paints and chatting, but each creating a different picture</li><li>Kids at a play area asking each other for turns with toys, but still playing their own separate games</li>
  </ul>
