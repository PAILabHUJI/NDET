  <h2>Explanation:</h2>
  <p>Your child played close to other children, often using the same toys or materials, but stayed focused on their own play. They did not work together, or interact much, even though they were side-by-side.</p>

  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Two children playing with the same set of building blocks, each making their own tower without helping each other</li><li>Children are painting side-by-side at the same table, but each works on their own separate picture</li><li>Children in the same sandbox, each digging on their own without playing together</li>
  </ul>
