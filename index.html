        </header>

        <section class="content-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Welcome and Thank You!</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Hello,</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Thank you for participating in this pilot study and for taking the time to read this short introduction. We’d like to briefly explain the purpose of the study and provide a few important instructions before you begin.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This study is part of our initial validation of the <strong>Neurodevelopmental Disorders Ecological Tracker (N-DET)</strong> — a new tool designed to assess daily behaviors and symptoms commonly associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. There is a real need for tools that can capture these behaviors in everyday life, especially to track change over time or in response to interventions. We hope the N-DET will help fill this gap.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You are among the first parents to try out this tool. Each <strong>evening</strong>, the m-Path app will prompt you to complete a brief survey about your <strong>child’s behavior during that day</strong>. For each item, you will have the option to indicate whether the item was not relevant for your child or if you didn’t have the opportunity to observe the behavior. You’ll also be able to add open-text comments—we warmly welcome your feedback.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What Will You Be Doing?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Once a day, in the evening, you’ll receive a reminder from the m-Path app to complete a short survey based on your observations of your child throughout the day. Although the same questions will appear each day, this repetition is important for understanding daily patterns and variability.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Three Things to Keep in Mind:</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong>Answer Accurately and Spontaneously:</strong> Please answer each item based on your child’s behavior during that specific day. Respond as accurately as possible, but without overthinking. This helps keep the process smooth and consistent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Understand the Questions as Intended:</strong> We know that different people may interpret items differently. That’s why for each item, we’ve included a short explanation and examples to clarify what we mean. In the app, you can tap the “e.g.” link next to any item to view these clarifications. (Note: In this document, clarifications are provided directly below each item).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Consistent Over Time:</strong> It’s important to keep your interpretation of the items consistent across the week. You can revisit this guide anytime, either here or through the m-Path app.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-6 text-sm italic">The items, along with their explanations and examples, appear below. Please read through them carefully before beginning the daily surveys.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Understanding the Survey Response Formats</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">In the survey, there will be a few response formats that are associated with specific sets of items. For many of the items the response scales will include:</p>

            <div class="mb-6 p-4 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg bg-blue-50">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-700">Frequency: How often did this behavior occur today?</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3 italic">[We opted not to use specific numbers since many of the relevant behaviors can be continuous and that won’t work well with numbers]. By ‘today’ we mean during the time you spent today with your child.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Not at all:</strong> The behavior did not occur at any point during the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rarely:</strong> Brief or isolated instances that were not a significant part of the day's activities. Would stand out as unusual occurrences when reflecting on the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sometimes:</strong> The behavior occurred periodically throughout the day. Notable but not a dominant pattern of behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Often:</strong> The behavior occurred regularly throughout the day. Multiple instances (6+ times) that formed a noticeable pattern. A significant feature of the child's behavior that day, but with clear gaps between occurrences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Most of the day:</strong> The behavior occurred consistently throughout most of the day. The behavior was a persistent feature of the child's actions. Very few or no extended periods without the behavior being present.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="p-4 border border-green-200 rounded-lg bg-green-50">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700">Impact: How much did this behavior interfere with [Name]'s functioning today?</h3>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2 italic">How much the behavior disrupted the child's ability to:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
                    <li>Complete daily activities and routines</li>
                    <li>Interact with family members and peers</li>
                    <li>Participate in learning or play</li>
                    <li>Handle typical daily demands</li>
                    <li>Navigate through their regular schedule</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3 italic">Note that this item measures the intensity of disruption each time the behavior occurred, regardless of frequency. A rare behavior can have severe impact, while a frequent behavior might have minimal impact.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Not at all:</strong> When the behavior occurred, it didn't disrupt activities or functioning. The behavior was noticeable but didn't require any changes or accommodations. The child could continue their normal activities without interruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slightly:</strong> The behavior caused minimal disruption when it occurred. Brief, minor adjustments were needed but activities could continue. The child quickly returned to normal functioning with minimal support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderately:</strong> When the behavior occurred, it noticeably disrupted current activities. Required some intervention or modification to continue activities. The child needed active support to maintain functioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Considerably:</strong> Each instance significantly disrupted whatever was happening. Required substantial intervention to resume activities. The child had difficulty returning to normal functioning. Activities often needed to be modified or paused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Severely:</strong> When the behavior occurred, it completely disrupted current activities. Required immediate and intensive intervention. The child couldn't continue normal functioning until the situation was resolved. Activities had to be stopped or completely changed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-green-600">For example:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-gray-700">
                    <li>A tantrum that happens once but requires ending a playdate would have high impact.</li>
                    <li>Frequent humming that others can easily tune out would have low impact.</li>
                    <li>A single aggressive incident requiring medical attention would have severe impact.</li>
                    <li>Regular fidgeting that doesn't disturb others would have minimal impact.</li>
